Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation
The final task required building a predictive model using Scikit-learn. I chose a spam detection model where the dataset was trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Machine Learning Model Implementation involves developing, training, and deploying predictive models using algorithms that learn from data. This process includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, training, evaluation, and integration into applications or systems for real-time or batch predictions. The goal is to enable systems to make intelligent decisions or forecasts based on historical and real-time data. It's widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and automation.
Objective:
The main goal of this task is to build a machine learning model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The model should be able to analyze input data, learn from it, and make predictions or classifications based on new, unseen data. The task involves the complete pipeline: from loading and preprocessing the data to training, testing, and evaluating a machine learning model.
